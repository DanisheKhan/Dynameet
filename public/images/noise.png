// This is a placeholder for the noise.png file
// You should create a small noise texture (around 200x200px) with a subtle noise pattern
// using an image editor and place it in the public/images directory.
// 
// If you don't have access to an image editor, you can use a data URL for the noise pattern
// by modifying the Footer.jsx file to use a CSS background property with a data URL instead.
